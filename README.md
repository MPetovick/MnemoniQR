## üîß Installation & Deployment

### Web Deployment
```bash
# Clone or download the project files
# Serve via any web server
python3 -m http.server 8000
# or
npx serve .
```

### Offline Usage (Recommended for Security)
1. Load application while online
2. Disconnect from internet
3. Reload page (Ctrl + F5) to load from cache
4. Use application in complete isolation

### PWA Installation
- **Chrome/Edge**: Click "Install App" when prompted
- **Safari**: Use "Add to Home Screen"
- **Firefox**: Use "Install Site as App"

## üéØ Use Cases

### Primary Use Cases
- **Secure Seed Backup**: Convert seeds to encrypted QR for physical storage
- **Multi-location Storage**: Distribute encrypted backups geographically
- **Inheritance Planning**: Create password-protected recovery options
- **Cold Storage Enhancement**: Add encryption layer to paper wallets

### Security Scenarios
- **Travel Security**: Carry encrypted QR without exposing seeds
- **Multi-signature Setup**: Distribute encrypted shares
- **Disaster Recovery**: Weather/fire-proof encrypted backups

## üîê Security Best Practices

### Password Management
- Use password managers for encryption passwords
- Never reuse passwords across different seeds
- Consider password splitting (Shamir's Secret Sharing)
- Store passwords separately from encrypted QRs

### Storage Recommendations
- Print QR codes on durable materials
- Use multiple storage locations
- Consider fire-proof/water-proof containers
- Regular integrity checks of backups

### Operational Security
- Perform encryption on trusted, malware-free devices
- Use offline mode for maximum security
- Verify decryption capability periodically
- Destroy temporary files/cache after use
